# 📊 Motorola Sales Performance Dashboard

# 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Motorola’s mobile sales across various Indian cities. It highlights key metrics like total sales, transactions, average order value, and monthly trends, enabling better decision-making. With interactive filters and slicers, users can drill down into specific insights based on brand, payment method, mobile model, and day-wise performance.
